## Coding Guidelines

### Vue Components
- Use Composition API with `<script setup>`
- Follow single-file component structure
- Keep components focused and small
- Use TypeScript for props and emits

### TypeScript
- Always define types for props, emits, and function parameters
- Avoid using `any` type
- Use interfaces over type aliases when possible

### Styling
- Use UnoCSS utility classes
- Keep component-specific styles in `<style scoped>`
- Follow mobile-first responsive design

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `ComponentRenderer.vue`)
- Composables: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`)
- Files: kebab-case for non-components
- CSS classes: kebab-case

### Git Commit Messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests

Examples:
```
feat: Add animation timeline editor
fix: Resolve memory leak in component renderer
docs: Update API documentation
style: Format code according to style guide
refactor: Extract reusable logic to composables
test: Add unit tests for editor store
chore: Update dependencies
```

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Aim for good coverage of critical paths
- Use descriptive test names

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Document complex logic with comments
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Update TypeScript types
