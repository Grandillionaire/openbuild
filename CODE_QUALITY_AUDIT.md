# 🔍 Code Quality Audit Report

## Overview
Comprehensive code review and quality assurance for all new OpenBuild enhancements.

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Scope:** Phase 1 & 2 implementations
**Status:** ✅ **PASSED - PRODUCTION READY**

---

## ✅ Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Missing Type Import** ✓ FIXED
**File:** `src/stores/editor.ts`
**Issue:** `ResponsiveStyles` type not imported
**Fix:** Added to import statement
```typescript
import type { Component, ComponentType, ResponsiveStyles } from '@/types/component';
```

### 2. **Memory Leak - Event Listeners** ✓ FIXED
**File:** `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.vue`
**Issue:** `mousedown` listener on `canvasRef` not cleaned up in `onUnmounted`
**Fix:** Store handler reference and remove in cleanup
```typescript
let mouseDownHandler: ((e: MouseEvent) => void) | null = null;

onMounted(() => {
  mouseDownHandler = (e: MouseEvent) => { /* ... */ };
  canvasRef.value.addEventListener('mousedown', mouseDownHandler);
});

onUnmounted(() => {
  if (canvasRef.value && mouseDownHandler) {
    canvasRef.value.removeEventListener('mousedown', mouseDownHandler);
    mouseDownHandler = null;
  }
});
```

### 3. **Multi-Select Event Handling** ✓ FIXED
**File:** `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.vue`
**Issue:** `selectComponent` couldn't access click event for Shift/Cmd detection
**Fix:** Added `handleCanvasClick` wrapper to capture events
```typescript
function handleCanvasClick(event: MouseEvent) {
  const target = event.target as HTMLElement;
  const componentEl = target.closest('[data-component-id]');

  if (componentEl) {
    const componentId = componentEl.getAttribute('data-component-id');
    if (event.shiftKey || event.metaKey || event.ctrlKey) {
      store.toggleComponentSelection(componentId, true);
    } else {
      // Single select
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. **TypeScript Type Errors** ✓ FIXED
**Files:** Multiple
**Issues & Fixes:**

a) **ResponsivePreviewGrid.vue**
- Removed unused `watch` import
- Removed unused `store` variable
- Added proper type annotations for `viewModes` array

b) **ComponentLibrary.vue**
- Fixed `expandedCategories` type: `reactive<Record<string, boolean>>({})`
- Removed unused icon imports (MousePointer, Home, Star, Phone)

c) **Type safety improvements:**
```typescript
// Before
const expandedCategories = reactive({ layout: true, ... });

// After
const expandedCategories = reactive<Record<string, boolean>>({ layout: true, ... });
```

## ✅ Code Quality Standards

### 1. **Type Safety**

- [x] `computed()` for derived state
- [x] Proper reactivity triggers (no direct mutations)

### 4. **Component Design**
- [x] Single Responsibility Principle
- [x] Props properly typed with interfaces

- [x] No mutations outside actions
- [x] Computed getters for derived state

### Event Handling
- [x] Event listeners removed on cleanup
- [x] `.stop` and `.prevent` used correctly
